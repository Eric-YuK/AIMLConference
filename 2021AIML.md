This annual conference was hosted at Chicago Booth in 2014, NYU Stern in 2015 and 2017, Stanford GSB in 2016, CMU Tepper in 2018, and Temple in 2019. It has attracted a vibrant group of professors, industry people, and PhD students (each year max 150 people) working on cutting-edge ML AI models and data in inter-disciplinary fields. This conference serves as an intellectual bridge between computer science, economics, statistics, marketing, management, finance, strategy, IS, healthcare, education, public policy, and others.
